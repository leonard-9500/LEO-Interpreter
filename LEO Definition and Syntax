// DEFINITION OF LEO PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
COMMAS AND SPACES MAY BE OMITTED.
IT'S PURELY COMMAND LINE. NO PIXELS ON THE SCREEN CAN BE SET. ONLY TEXT/NUMBER OUTPUT
V: NUMERICAL INT OR FLOAT VALUE (E.G. 3, 3.1415, 45)
S: STRING ("HELLO", "\N")
X: USER-DEFINED VARIABLE NAME
KEYWORDS:
ADD
SUB
MUL
DIV
INT
SET
PRINT
CLS
GOTO
FUNC
//
$

// ADD THE SECOND VALUE TO THE FIRST VALUE AND STORE THE RESULT IN THE FIRST VARIABLE. SO ADD 5, 2 = 7
ADD X|V, X|V
// SUBTRACT THE SECOND VALUE FROM THE FIRST VALUE AND STORE THE RESULT IN THE FIRST VARIABLE. SO SUB 5, 2 = 3
SUB X|V, X|V
// MULTIPLY THE SECOND VALUE BY THE FIRST VALUE AND STORE THE RESULT IN THE FIRST VARIABLE. SO SUB 5, 2 = 2*5 = 10
MUL X|V, X|V
// DIVIDE THE FIRST VALUE BY THE SECOND VALUE AND STORE THE RESULT IN THE FIRST VARIABLE. SO SUB 5, 2 = 5/2 = 2.5
// IF THE VARIABLE IS AN INT IT ALWAYS REMOVES (AKA FLOORS) THE DECIMAL POINT.
// ADDING 0.5 THE THE SECOND VALUE BEFORE DIVIDING HAS THE EFFECT OF ROUNDING INSTEAD OF FLOORING.
DIV X|V, X|V
// CREATE AN INT VARIABLE NAMED S AND ASSIGN THE VALUE X OR V TO IT. FLOOR DECIMAL POINT IF SUPPLIED
INT S, X|V
// ASSIGN THE VALUE X OR V TO THE VARIABLE X. IF VARIABLE IS AN INT, FLOOR DECIMAL POINT IF SUPPLIED.
SET X, X|V
// OUTPUT THE VALUE OF THE NUMBER, VARIABLE OR STRING TO THE CONSOLE.
PRINT X|V|S
// SET THE PC TO THE ADDRESS CORRESPONDING TO THE SUPPLIED FUNCTION NAME
GOTO X|V
// CLEAR THE SCREEN
CLS
// CREATE A FUNCTION NAMED X. ";" ENDS THE FUNCTION BODY. THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE FUNCTION MUST LIE BETWEEN THE START AND END LINE OF THE FUNCTION.
// SO ANY FUNCTION IS AT LEAST 3 LINES LONG.
// WHEN EXECUTED THE ADDRESS OF THE PC GETS STORED ON THE STACK
// AND THE PC IS SET TO THE ADDRESS FOLLOWING THE FUNC DECLARATION. WHEN READING THE ";" THE LAST ADDRESS OF THE PC
// GETS POPPED OFF THE STACK AND ASSIGNED TO THE PC.
FUNC X
;
// Precedes any user-defined string literal
$

// "//" starts a single-line comment. Any code following this keyword is omitted for this line.
// Any text can go in here.

instructions on a line must be separated by whitespace.

// EXAMPLE PROGRAM

INT X 5
PRINT "X IS "
PRINT X  // PRINTS 5
ADD X 2
PRINT X // PRINTS 7
PRINT $Hello, World! // PRINTS "Hello, World!"
